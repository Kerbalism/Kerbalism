About Kerbalism
===============

Kerbalism was originally created by ShotgunNinja. It is now under active development by N70 and a number of contributors.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Any KSP version from 1.3.1 to 1.6.x
- Community Resource Pack (CRP)
- ModuleManager 4.0.2+

The Kerbalism release zip from v2.0.0 onwards will work for all the stated versions of KSP, basically one zip for all versions, no longer are there separate zips needed for a specific version of KSP.

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC_. If you opt-in, it will use the Internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the Internet and no personal information is sent. For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the `KSP-AVC Plugin`_.
