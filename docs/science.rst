Storage
-------

The stock science data container is replaced by a solid state drive. The data stored is organized in files and can be managed using a dedicated UI.

Transmission
------------

Files can be flagged for transmission home and they will be sent to DSN at the first opportunity. The transmission happens over time, even when the vessels are unloaded. Transmission times can range from mere seconds to months, depending on the size of the file transmitted and the transmission rate of the connection.

Analysis
--------

Some data is not transmissible, these are considered samples and need to be recovered or analyzed in a lab. Samples are flagged for analysis and then analyzed over time in a laboratory. As the analysis proceeds the sample will be slowly converted into transmissible data.

Transferring data
-----------------

It is possible to transfer files from a drive to another drive in the same vessel, even without a crew. It is sufficient to click on 'transfer data here' in the UI of the part desired.

When two vessels dock, their Hard Drives are merged. When they undock the Hard Drive in the vessel that has control gets all the data.

Kerbals can interact with Hard Drives by taking or storing data during EVA's.

Tweaks
------

Stock experiments get some tweaks, the data is transmissible completely or not at all, situation and biome combinations have been altered, the need to repeat the same experiment in a situation multiple times has been removed and the science credits returned have been rebalanced.

Supported experiments
---------------------

The Science system supports stock experiments and other experiments that use the Science Dialog.
