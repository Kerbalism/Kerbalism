Science
=======

Kerbalism introduces a new and very different science system to Kerbal Space Program. Experiments need time to complete and will generate heaps of data. Data storage capacity on vessels is limited, and the experiments will stop sampling new science output when no storage space is available.

----------

Storage
-------
The stock science data container is replaced by a solid state drive. The data stored is organized in files and can be managed using a dedicated UI. You can delete less valuable samples to make room for more valuable ones.

----------

Transmission
------------
Files can be flagged for transmission home and they will be sent to DSN at the first opportunity. The transmission happens over time, even when the vessels are unloaded. Transmission times can range from mere seconds to months, depending on the size of the file transmitted and the transmission rate of the connection.

----------

Samples
-------

Some experiment results are not transmissible, these are considered samples and need to be recovered or analyzed in a lab. Samples are stored in bags that can be flagged for analysis, and then will be analyzed over time in a laboratory. As the analysis proceeds the sample will be slowly converted into transmissible data.

Samples have mass. Some Experiments like the Goo Container contain just a few grams of sampling material (mystery goo) that is used up while the goo observation takes place. Once the sampling material is used up, the experiment cannot be rerun. Other experiments will collect samples from the atmosphere or the surface. A surface sample for example will collect 12kg of mass that should be accounted for when it needs to be transported back.

----------

Transferring data
-----------------
It is possible to transfer files from a drive to another drive in the same vessel, even without a crew. It is sufficient to click on 'transfer data here' in the UI of the part desired. Samples cannot be transferred without a Kerbal present.

When two vessels dock, their Hard Drives are merged. When they undock the Hard Drive in the vessel that has control gets all the data.

Kerbals can interact with Hard Drives by taking or storing data during EVA's.

----------

Tweaks
------
Stock experiments get some tweaks, the data is transmissible completely or not at all, situation and biome combinations have been altered, the need to repeat the same experiment in a situation multiple times has been removed and the science credits returned have been rebalanced.

----------

Supported experiments
---------------------
The Science system supports stock experiments and other experiments that use the Science Dialog.
