Downloads and Links
===================

Latest release
--------------

- You can find the latest release of Kerbalism on SpaceDock_

- If you like taking risks you can find the latest build and source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/steamp0rt/Kerbalism>`_. **Warning** There may be unfinished features and more bugs than you originally had using a GitHub build, use it at your own risk and check the CHANGELOG.md_ file for the latest changes.

- Also A zip from the GitHub repository is not the same as a release zip from SpaceDock but it is not much different, just make sure not to copy the entire contents into your GameData folder. Basically download the zip from GitHub and only copy the content that is in the GameData folder.
