So, you're about to go to Mun?
==============================

Kerbalism adds about six new ways to get your crew killed. If this is your first attempt at Mun with Kerbalism, read this tutorial or bring some body bags. You have been warned.

Before you go...
----------------

Let's assume you've just started a new career game and are about to do your first missions to Mun. You didn't expand your VAB or launch pad, so you're limited to vessels with a maximum of 30 parts and 18 tons. A crewed mission to Mun isn't trivial under these circumstances, and with Kerbalism it's going to be a new challenge, even if you've done many missions to Mun in earlier games.

In order to survive with Kerbalism, Kerbals need enough food, water and oxygen for the duration of the entire mission. Command pods contain enough of these to last for 5 days, which is just enough for a Mun flyby. Anything beyond that will require additional supplies, so stick to a Mun flyby - and a Mun flyby only. Do not orbit Mun. Do not land on Mun. And don't even think about Minmus, not yet. Any deviation from that will get your crew killed for a number of reasons, starvation just being one of them.

The most important resource on any crewed vessel is electricity. Without it, your crew will suffocate, freeze or burn to death, whichever kills them first. Not having food for your ship won't be your number one problem when climatization fails and you burn up in the sun. So, let's take care of that first.

Minimum requirements
--------------------

You need a reliable method to generate electricity. If you haven't researched solar panels or fuel cell generators yet, go ahead and do that first. You won't survive a trip to Mun without a way to generate electricity.

If at all possible, don't rely on solar panels only, bring a fuel cell. As a general rule, fuel cells will keep your Kerbals alive, so get into the habit of using them early. The thing about solar panels is that they need to see the sun, and all of your missions will spend a lot of time in shadow.

Ship construction
-----------------

If you're going with fuel cells (recommended), attach a H2+O2 (Hydrogen+Oxygen) fuel cell generator to your ship. Also attach a small pressurized tank that contains Hydrogen, and if you can an extra tank for Oxygen. The fuel cell will consume Oxygen while it runs, which might become a problem for your Kerbals if you don't have enough of it. Having solar panels can reduce the consumption of H2 and O2.

While a H2+O2 fuel cell is running, it will also produce some water. Make sure you have a bit of storage capacity for that excess water, otherwise the fuel cell will not run. The easiest way to do that is to reduce the amount of water in your command pod just a little, to make sure the cell can kick in early in the mission. Storing excess water won't be a problem later in your mission as the crew will drink most of it.

Other than that, you can build your vessel just like you did without Kerbalism. However, do not add any shielding to your command pod. You won't need it as you're not going to be in space for very long, and a fully shielded pod is so heavy that it comes with all sorts of issues when landing. For instance, it won't float on water.

Launch window
-------------

If you don't have a fuel cell, don't launch unless you're certain that Mun will not pass through Kerbins shadow while you're up there. At the beginning of a new game, Mun is just about to pass behind Kerbin - so wait a couple of days before you launch. Otherwise you will die in the shadow.

Just before launch
------------------

If you have a fuel cell, you probably don't want it to be running all the time. Kerbalism comes with an on board device manager that can turn on your fuel cell when your batteries are empty, and turn it back off when your batteries are charged. Doing that will save you a lot of Hydrogen and Oxygen, especially when you also have solar panels that recharge your batteries.

What's next?
------------

Launch! Fingers crossed, you'll make it back from a Mun flyby before you run out of oxygen, food, water, electricity or hydrogen.

You will probably notice that humidity in your command pod rises. Remember all the water your crew is drinking? It's dripping from your instrument panels now. Not an ideal situation, but for a short trip not a reason of concern. However, for longer missions you will need extra ECLSS units with humidity controllers.

Your next steps will be a Mun orbit and a mun landing. And then a trip to Minmus - but make sure you bring enough snacks for 20 days.
