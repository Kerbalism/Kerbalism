	/// ResourceRecipe is a mean of converting inputs to outputs.
	/// It does so in relation with the rest of the resource simulation to detect available amounts for inputs and available capacity for outputs.
	/// Outputs can be defined a "dumpeable" to avoid this last limitation.
	/// </summary>

	// TODO : (GOTMACHINE) the "combined" feature (ability for an input to substitute another if not available) added a lot of complexity to the Recipe code,
	// all in the purpose of a minor feature for greenhouses (CO2 / Waste automatic substitution)
	// If at some point we rewrite greenhouses and get ride of that stuff it would be a good idea to revert the changes made in this commit :
	// https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism/commit/91a154b0eeda8443d9dd888c2e40ca511c5adfa3#diff-ffbaadfd7e682c9dcb3912d5f8c5cabb

	// TODO : (GOTMACHINE) At some point, we want to use "virtual" resources in recipes.
	// Their purpose would be to give the ability to scale the non-resource output of a pure consumer.
	// Example : to scale antenna data rate by EC availability, define an "antennaOutput" virtual resource and a recipe that convert EC to antennaOutput
	// then check "antennaOutput" availability to scale the amount of data sent
	// This would also allow removing the "Cures" thing.

	// TODO : (yup another one) : in 95% of cases, the same recipes are recreated every update, with only a modification of the Entry.quantity field.
	// It would make a lot of sense to move Entry from a struct to a class and to make Recipe users keep the Recipe/Entry references, then just adjust the Entry.quantity.
	// That would notably allow to call only once GetResource() at the entry ctor (instead of again and again for each recipe execution step)
	// and change Recipe from okayish to lightning fast from a performance standpoint, as well as eliminate all heap memory allocations.

	// TODO : currently, "pure input recipes can just underflow", which is an issue for AvailabilityFactor calculations.
	// Since Recipes are assumed to auto-scale with availability, they register their consumptions in consumeCriticalRequests
	// and aren't scaled by AvailabilityFactor. The fix is probably to just remove the "if (outputs.Count > 0)" condition, but
	// I need to check that in detail before messing with this
