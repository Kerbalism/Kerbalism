// Catch-all patch to limit the data size of all experiment definitions.
// Rationale: not doing that will mean that people will have to transmit dozens of
// megabytes (if they were lucky enough to be able to store them in the first place)
// for the simplest experiments, because without Kerbalism science, the
// data size does not matter at all and as a consequence, modders don't care.
// Experiments that have dedicated Kerbalism support will have their values applied
// later by the mod specific patches, and all others should be very much playable
// using the stock science dialog and the data storages we give them.

// We used to globally set scienceCap = baseValue, for all experiments, to remove
// the necessity to repeat science experiments multiple times.
//
// And then came breaking grounds (Serenity).
//
// Serenity uses baseValue as the hourly rate and scienceCap as the total value
// of an experiment, so we can't do that globally any more, we need to exclude
// the surface experiments.
