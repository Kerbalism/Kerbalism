// Lab exclusive experiments (with the exception of goo and matbay).
// tried to cover most situations (landed, orbital, underwater, flying)
// makes the labs have a purpose again.
// I preffer for the labs to require scientists at varying levels present at all times to do the experiments.
// high ec requirements are appropriate imo, adds a requirement to design stuff properly.
