// Tweaking hints
//
// Put desired scientific value into value, that will
// later be copied onto baseValue. We need to do this because KSP calculates
// the size of an experiment thusly: dataScale * baseValue = size in Mb
// ECCost is the required EC/s for the experiment to run
// duration is the desired experiment duration in seconds (thus the large numbers)
// requirements are kerbalism introduced requirements, on top of the already existing stock ones
// (requirements need to be written in a specific way, otherwise they won't work.
// for info, check https://github.com/SirMortimer/Kerbalism/blob/master/docs/modders/modules.rst )
//
// In Kerbalism terms...
// baseValue = the scientific value of an experiment (science points)
// dataScale = megabytes per science points
// scienceCap is irrelevant.
// ============================================================================
// My general idea of balancing - Crewed experiments give more science,
// due to ship design complexity and life support factors.
// Unmanned experiments will net less to compensate
