// GOT 2019-22-11 :
// WildBlueTools is a common mod used by most of Angel-125 mods (BARIS, Buffalo, DSEV, MOLE, Pathfinder...)
// It define an Atmosphere resource used for the Airships mod, overriding our own atmosphere definition
// with a much higher density. Since changing the resource name would break all saves, this won't be fixed
// so the Airships mod will still be incompatible (sorry for that), but at least we regain compatibility with the
// other WBI mods.
