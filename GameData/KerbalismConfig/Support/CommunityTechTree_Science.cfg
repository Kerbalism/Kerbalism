// ============================================================================
// Tweaks to tech tree positions based on the CTT nodes.
// Tweaks are done to KERBALISM_GROUP_SETTINGS, as all the other patches
// directly pull values from them, this is the most efficient way of patching groups
// Parts themselves are changed in their own CTT patches by the mods themselves,
// therefore, only the groups need tweaks.
// ============================================================================

// patching only some crewed/LAB experiments, the others are in a good spot as is.
