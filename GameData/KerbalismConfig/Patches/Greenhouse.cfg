    // In a hydroponic system plants grow in water containing nutrients, the

    // In a regenerative system (see https://www.ag.arizona.edu/lunargreenhouse/Documents/2012-07-20_01_Giacomelli.pdf
    // slide 19) water is also produced.
    // 1 unit of Food has a mass 0.28 kg (see community resource pack),
    // therefore we will use 1.8 L/kg * 0.28 kg = 0.5 L of Water
    // 1 unit of Water matches 1 L, so we need 0.5 units of Water per unit of Food.
