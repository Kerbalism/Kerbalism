    // In a hydroponic system plants grow in water containing nutrients, the system is assumed to be closed loop.
    // Therefore only the water loss during photosynthesis is modeled.

    // Water efficient foods require around 250-500 L water per kg of crop (see https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste)
    // In a regenerative system (see https://www.ag.arizona.edu/lunargreenhouse/Documents/2012-07-20_01_Giacomelli.pdf slide 19) water is also produced.
    // In this example effective water consumption is 4.3 L per day. Every day approximately 2.4 kg of biomass is produced (not all of which can be eaten).
    // In this example the effective water consumption per kg of biomass is 1.8 L/kg.
    // TODO: Figure out what percentage of biomass actually becomes Food.
    // TODO: Figure how to recover the non-eatable biomass.
    // 1 unit of Food has a mass 0.28 kg (see community resource pack), therefore we will use 1.8 L/kg * 0.28 kg = 0.5 L of Water
