		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_LaytheInSpaceLow = As you look down at the beautiful ocean below, you forget that you are slowly dying of radiation poisoning.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_VallInSpaceLow = Amazingly, the radiation levels are at a reasonable level.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_TyloInSpaceLow = The subtle magnetosphere of Tylo acts as a generator, magnifying Jool's already intense radiation field.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_BopInSpaceLow = Bop has an abnormally high amount of radiation that seems to be pin-pointed at 68 degrees north, 114 degrees east. Strange
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_PolInSpaceLow = The space around Pol is filled with radioactive ions that have been unfortunate enough to be caught by Jool's magnetosphere.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_EelooInSpaceLow = R&D is keen to study what effects the large amount of interstellar radiation has done to the surface of Eeloo.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_SunInSpaceHigh = The KSC informs you that they *may* have forgotten to add the shielding.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_MohoInSpaceHigh = The radiation from the sun has picked up dramatically over the course of your journey.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_EveInSpaceHigh = You are not looking forward to traveling through Eve's radiation belt.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_GillyInSpaceHigh = You refuse to check the radiation levels unless the KSC stops making Potato puns.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_KerbinInSpaceHigh = This place is dangerous.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_MunInSpaceHigh = You crossed Kerbin's radiation belt, and did not die. You worry that this will spawn a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_MinmusInSpaceHigh = You pick up an abnormal amount of radiation, but can't figure out the origin.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna doesn’t seem to have a magnetosphere, so cosmic radiation will be a problem for future Duna missions.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_IkeInSpaceHigh = Unexpectedly, Ike appears to be magnetic enough to mess with the ion's striped from Duna's atmosphere.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_DresInSpaceHigh = In the asteroid, nobody can hear you face palm when you realise that you forgot the Geiger counter.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_JoolInSpaceHigh = The radiation being emitted from Jool is a staggering amount, and you start to wish you were on the Duna exploration mission.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe is, incredibly, putting up a large resistance to the onslaught of Jool's radiation belt. God speed Laythe. God speed.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_VallInSpaceHigh = Even though Vall isn't located in the main radiation belt, it is still viciously punished by Jool's radiation.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_TyloInSpaceHigh = The radiation from Jool forms an intense belt around Tylo, but luckily it doesn’t look like much reaches the surface. But much is a relative term.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_BopInSpaceHigh = Bop actually seems to be a source of intense radiation, but amongst Jool's radiation field, it doesn’t appear significant.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_PolInSpaceHigh = Pol is far enough away from Jool that it receives ionized isotopes sourced from Jool's magnetosphere and interplanetary gas.
		#KERBALISM_EXPERIMENT_Radiation_EelooInSpaceHigh = As Kerbol's influence weakens, interstellar radiation becomes much more pronounced. The secrets of the galaxy lay open to you.
