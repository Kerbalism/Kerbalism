//changes to science mechanics based on kerbalism's modules.
//patches are structured this way for ease of patching parts and mods.


//If you wish to patch your own part, go to StockPartPatches/Template.txt
//it's a template on how to add some bundles to any part you wish.
//individual parts with single experiments have to be done manually.
//stock and supported mods are patched "properly"
//unsupported ones retain their default behavior (instant science for the click of a button)
