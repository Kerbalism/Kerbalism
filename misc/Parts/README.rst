3D Part files for Kerbalism
===========================

Here you will find the 3D Object and Texture files used with Unity and a 3D Editor such as Blender to create the the KSP .mu files used for Kerbalisms parts.

In each folder for a Kerbalism part you will find:

- 3D Editor files such as .blend for Blender etc.
- Assets folder that contains files necessary for Unity and any textures, materials etc needed for 3D Editors.
- Final folder that contains finished files ready to be used in the GameData/Kerbalism/Parts folders.

For converting textures to the DDS format you can use the DDS4KSP app available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Telanor/DDS4KSP/releases>`_ this app will automatically flip the texture and use the correct DXT format for KSP, remember to uncheck the create mipmaps option though ;)
