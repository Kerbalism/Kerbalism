take a look at the experiment part configs for: cloud, wing, ding, tick, beep, curve
- adjust tech tree locations
- adjust price + mass
- maybe turn one of them into a sample?

make sure spectro variometer works
make sure pressmat barometer works

underwater experiments are currently disabled (removed the group from the spctro variometer).
i am not sure if they should be in kerbalism, or at which location in the tech tree. it is
notoriously difficult to build anything that even can go underwater without additional part
mods.
