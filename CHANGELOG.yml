    - New parts MiniPump and RadialPump to extract Water, Nitrogen and Ammonia from
      oceans (thanks to JadeOfMom for the Harvesters and PiezPiedPy for the parts)
    - Harvesters are now spec'd at 10% abundance by default (madman2003)
    - Harvesting rate scales linearly with abundance (madman2003)
    - Water harvesting has been buffed by a factor 6 (at the reference 10% abundance)
      compared to release 1.5.1 (madman2003)
    - Restored antenna simulation button (PiezPiedPy)
    - Fix greenhouse animation for SSPX (madman2003)

    - Fix harvesters background simulation, as well as scaling the produced resources
      by abundance (madman2003)
    - Fix SSPX inflatable habitats and centrifuges to have crew capacity and somewhat
      realistic habitat volumes/areas (madman2003)
    - Add nitrogen storage to SSPX modules containing a pressurization module (madman2003)
    - Add habitat to Kerbalism gravity ring (madman2003)
    - A first attempt at scaling Kerbalism UI to follow KSP UI scaling
    - Clicking the middle mouse button on the popout menu will now close the popout
      window if it is already open.

      than what ISS achieves in real life)
    - Kerbalism CO2 tanks are now full by default in order to supply Greenhouses with
      CO2 (madman2003)
    - Fix display of Habitat volume and space in tooltip, they used to be swapped
      (madman2003)
    - Minor fixes to SSPX config file (madman2003)
    - Add Electrolysis with H2 priority and Sabatier with H2O priority (madman2003)
    - Give Greenhouses the basic resources needed to run (madman2003)
    - There is now a help file on GitHub for those wishing to report bugs or contribute
      to Kerbalism.

      rules, supplies etc (thanks to PiezPiedPy)

      calls buttons,
    date: '2018-05-26'
  v1.7.0 for KSP 1.4.3:
    changes:
    - Moved Humidity into Habitation (PiezPiedPy)
    - Pressure and CO2 Poisoning rates are back to normal (PiezPiedPy)
    - GravityRing NRE's in VAB/SPH bug fixed (PiezPiedPy)
    - Click through prevention added (some things can still be clicked through the
      windows, due to using KSP's old style Gui) (PiezPiedPy)
    - Overhaul to transmitter use, planning and monitoring, data rates, signal strength,
      EC cost and targets now work. Internal transmitters are separate from external
      transmitters and will only transmit telemetry and command control, they are
      also shown separately in the planner and are constantly powered unless you run
      out of EC, with the added benefit of loosing contact with DSN and subsequent
      control. External transmitters will lose contact when retracted, break, or if
      you run out of EC rendering long distance comms, call home and your ability
      to transmit science to zero. External transmitters will also stop using EC when
      retracted. EVA suits now contain a small internal transmitter for transmitting
      telemetry and controlling remote probes and rovers etc. All transmitters have
      had their EC usage changed to more realistic values and are also combinable.
      There is a minor drawback though, when changing scenes with the [ESC]Pause menu
      you may notice the target readout pointing to the wrong vessel and some signals
      that where previously dis-connected wrongly connecting back online, simply changing
      scene from for example the Space Center to Tracking Station will solve all errors
      in the network. *Thanks to (PiezPiedPy) for the transmitter overhaul.*
