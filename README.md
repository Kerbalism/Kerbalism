**Installation checklist** for the "GameData" folder required content : 

- `CommunityResourcePack` (folder)
- `Kerbalism` (folder)
- `KerbalismConfig` (folder, can be replaced by a third-party config pack)
- `ModuleManager.X.X.X.dll` (file)

## Mod compatibility and support

Checking the **[mod compatibility]** page is **mandatory before installing Kerbalism on a heavily modded game**.

Kerbalism does very custom stuff. This can break other mods. For a lot of mods that breaks or need balancing, we provide support code and configuration patches. However some mods are incompatible because there is too much feature overlap or support is too complex to implement.
